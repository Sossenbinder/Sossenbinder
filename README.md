### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Glad you found my private Github profile!

This is a personal coding space I spend my free time on, since coding does not stop after clocking out at 5pm for me.

It contains various projects, some public, some private, mostly centered around:
- Dotnet & C# 
- Javascript
- Cloud (Kubernetes & Docker)
- Serverless (Azure Functions)

ðŸ“– I love diving into new concepts, so be prepared to find some PoC repositories here as well.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on whatever sounds interesting, paid or free. Leave me a message if you have something in mind!

ðŸ’¬ Additionally, I am always happy to help and teach people. If you think my skillset can help you, don't hesitate to shoot me a message ðŸ“¨
